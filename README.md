RCBasic Programming Language

RCBasic is a free and open source dialect of the BASIC programming language.  It is intended to
be a simple and powerful language for developing games and multimedia software.  As this is
open source software, anyone is welcome to contribute ideas, documentation, and code to help
improve it.


Special Thanks to the sdlBasic community and the retrogamecoding and BP community.
