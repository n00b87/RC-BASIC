  <body><strong><span  style="text-decoration: underline;">COMMENTS<br>
      </span></strong> <strong><br>
    </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comments in RC BASIC have to be on a separate
    line from executable code.&nbsp; To make a comment you would use a single
    quote.&nbsp; Look at the following:<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' THIS IS A CORRECT COMMENT<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Print "HELLO WORLD"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' THIS
    IS AN INCORRECT COMMENT.&nbsp; COMMENTS MUST BE ON SEPARATE LINES FROM CODE<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the above example the first line is correct.&nbsp; It
    starts the line with a comment.&nbsp; The second line however attempts to
    add a comment to a line that already has code on it.&nbsp; That line will
    not compile.
