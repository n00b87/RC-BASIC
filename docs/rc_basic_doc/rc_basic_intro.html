  <body><strong><span  style="text-decoration: underline;">INTRODUCTION TO THE
        RC BASIC PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE<br>
        <br>
      </span></strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First I would like to say thank you
    for taking an interest in RC BASIC ( I use all caps because I think it looks
    more retro that way).&nbsp; RC BASIC is a variant of the BASIC programming
    language.&nbsp; It consist of a compiler, interpreter, and a code
    editor.&nbsp; This version of BASIC was mostly influenced by sdlBasic and
    QBasic.&nbsp; My main reason for writing this software was just to have fun
    and challenge myself.&nbsp; This language is not as full featured as C++ or
    Java but you can still create some awesome stuff with it.&nbsp; I hope you
    have as much fun using this software as I had making it.<br>
