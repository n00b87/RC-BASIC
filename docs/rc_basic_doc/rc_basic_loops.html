    </span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RC BASIC has 3 types of loops: FOR, WHILE, and
    DO.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The FOR loop repeats a block of code and increments a
    counter each time it finishes the block between FOR and NEXT.&nbsp; When the
    counter reaches a certain value the FOR LOOP stops.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FOR I = 1 TO 5<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PRINT I<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NEXT<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The above code will output the numbers 1 to 5 to the
    console. Optionally you could use the STEP keyword to set the number that
    the counter will increase by.&nbsp; Look at the following:<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FOR I = 1 TO 5 STEP 2<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PRINT I<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NEXT<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The above code will output the numbers 1, 3, and 5 to the
    console.&nbsp; The STEP keyword increases I by 2 each time through the FOR
    loop.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WHILE loops will execute a block of code while a certain
    condition is true.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I = 0<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WHILE I &lt; 5<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PRINT I<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I = I + 1<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WEND<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The above code will output the numbers 0 to 4.&nbsp; It
    will not output the number 5 because if ( I &lt; 5 ) is false the loop will
    not repeat.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The DO loop is similar to the WHILE loop with an
    exception.&nbsp; The WHILE loop checks for the loop condition at the start
    of the loop but the DO loop checks for the loop condition at the end of the
    loop.&nbsp; What this means is that a WHILE loop will never execute if the
    condition is false at the start but the DO loop is guaranteed to execute at
    least once before it checks if the condition was true or not.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The DO loop is also unique in that it has 3 different
    forms.&nbsp; Here is the simplest form of the DO loop.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DO<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PRINT "HELLO WORLD"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LOOP<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The code above will continue to output HELLO WORLD to the
    console infinitely.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I = 0<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DO<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PRINT I<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I = I + 1<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LOOP WHILE I &lt; 5<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The above code will output the numbers 0 to 4 to the
    console.&nbsp; This form of the DO loop will continue to loop while the loop
    condition is true.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I = 0<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DO<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PRINT I<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I = I + 1<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LOOP UNTIL I = 5<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The above code will output the numbers 0 to 4 to the
    console.&nbsp; This form of the DO loop will continue to loop until the loop
    condition is true.
