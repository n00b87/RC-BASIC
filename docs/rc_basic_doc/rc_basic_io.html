    </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RC BASIC has two ways of getting output to a text
    console.&nbsp; The first way is the PRINT keyword shown here:<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PRINT "HELLO WORLD"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PRINT 5<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The above example outputs HELLO WORLD to the console,
    goes to the next line, and outputs 5 to the console.&nbsp; Since PRINT
    automatically adds a new line you may want to use the FPRINT function
    instead.&nbsp; FPRINT works similiar to PRINT except it does not
    automatically go to the next line.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FPRINT("HELLO WORLD\n")<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The above line outputs HELLO WORLD to the console and the
    uses the "\n" escape character to go to the next line.&nbsp; See the section
    on Escape Characters for more information on how escape characters work.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To get input from the user you would use the INPUT$
    function.&nbsp; INPUT$ will display a prompt to the user and then get input
    from the console.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; USER_NAME$ = INPUT$("WHAT IS YOUR NAME? ")<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The above example will ask the user WHAT IS YOUR NAME?
    and then store whatever the user types in into the variable USER_NAME$.
