      </span></strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RC BASIC uses a concept used in
    sdlbasic and borrowed from AMOS on the Amiga about using virtual render
    targets to draw on.&nbsp; In RC BASIC these virtual render targets are
    called canvases.&nbsp; You must have at least one canvas open in order to
    draw anything in a window.&nbsp; Look at the following:<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WINDOWOPEN ( 0, "TEST WINDOW", 100, 100, 640, 480, 0 )<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CANVASOPEN ( 0, 640, 480, 0, 0, 640, 480, 0 )<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The above example is a simple example of opening a window
    and canvas so you can start drawing.&nbsp; The first line opens a 640x480
    window at coordinate (100, 100).&nbsp; The second line opens canvas 0 as a
    640x480 render target and sets its viewport to 640x480 area starting at (0,
    0) in the window.&nbsp; Now that a window and canvas are open you can start
    drawing.&nbsp; Once you are done drawing you need to call UPDATE to display
    what you have drawn.&nbsp; Look at the following:<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WINDOWOPEN ( 0, "TEST WINDOW", 100, 100, 640, 480, 0 )<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CANVASOPEN ( 0, 640, 480, 0, 0, 640, 480, 0 )<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SETCOLOR( RGB ( 255, 255, 255 ) )<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BOX ( 20, 20, 60, 60 )<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UPDATE ( )<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This example draws a white rectangle to the screen.&nbsp;
    The first two lines are pulled from the previous example.&nbsp; The third
    line sets the color used for drawing.&nbsp; The fourth line draws a
    rectangle from coordinate (20, 20) to coordinate(60, 60).&nbsp; And the last
    line shows what you just drew on the screen.&nbsp; RC BASIC allows a total
    of 8 windows and 16 canvases with a total of 32768 images that can be loaded
    in your program.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sound in RC BASIC is handled the same way as canvases or
    images.&nbsp; You can load a sound into slot and play the sound on a
    selected channel.&nbsp; Look at the following:<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LOADSOUND ( 0, "MYSOUND.WAV" )<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PLAYSOUND ( 0, 1, 3 )<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The above code will load a sound into sound slot 0.&nbsp;
    The second line plays the sound in channel 1 for 3 loops.&nbsp; You can have
    a total of 1024 sounds loaded in your program.&nbsp; For music and video you
    can only load one and choose to play it or delete it from your programs
    memory and load another.&nbsp; Look at the following:<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LOADMUSIC ( "MYMUSIC.MP3" )<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PLAYMUSIC ( -1 )<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The above code loads a music track.&nbsp; The second line
    tells the music to play infinitely.&nbsp; To change music tracks you would
    first call DELETEMUSIC and then simply call LOADMUSIC again.
